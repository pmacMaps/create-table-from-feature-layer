# create-table-from-feature-layer

This project contains sample code for generating a tabular view of an Esri REST Feature Service.  Even though a Feature Service is a geographic dataset, there may be times when you want to create a table-based view of the data.

I'm using the [ArcGIS REST JS](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/) to request the feature service.  [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is being used to bundle the app/website.
